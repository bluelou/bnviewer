## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(bnlearn)
library(bnviewer)

data(gaussian.test)
bn.learn.hc = hc(gaussian.test)

plot(bn.learn.hc, 
     bayesianNetwork.layout = "layout_with_mds",
     bayesianNetwork.title="Gaussian Bayesian Network",
     bayesianNetwork.subtitle = "Example anywhere", 
     bayesianNetwork.footer = "Fig. 1 - Gaussian Bayesian Network",
     edges.dashes = FALSE)

```

```{r  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(bnlearn)
library(bnviewer)

data(gaussian.test)
bn.learn.hc = hc(gaussian.test)

plot(bn.learn.hc, 
     bayesianNetwork.layout = "layout_in_circle",
     bayesianNetwork.title="Gaussian Bayesian Network",
     bayesianNetwork.subtitle = "Example anywhere", 
     bayesianNetwork.footer = "Fig. 1 - Gaussian Bayesian Network",
     edges.dashes = TRUE)

```

The ALARM ("A Logical Alarm Reduction Mechanism") is a Bayesian network designed to provide an alarm message system for patient monitoring.

```{r  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(bnlearn)
library(bnviewer)

data("alarm")
bn.learn.hc = hc(alarm)

plot(bn.learn.hc, 
     bayesianNetwork.title="Alarm Bayesian Network",
     bayesianNetwork.subtitle = "Example anywhere", 
     bayesianNetwork.footer = "Fig. 1 - Alarm Bayesian Network",
     edges.dashes = TRUE)

```
